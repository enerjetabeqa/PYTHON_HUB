[GOOGLE TRENDS DATA ANALYSIS.py] [GOOGLE TRENDS DATA ANALYSIS.ipynb]

## Project Description

This project involved creating a Python-based dashboard to visualize and analyze Google Trends data. The key goals were to:

- Track search volume trends over time for keywords and categories
- Compare trends across different categories like movies, brands etc.
- Identify seasonal patterns and outlier events driving search spikes
- Forecast future search volume using time series models
- Analyze the top search queries within categories
- Visualize search popularity for keywords as heatmaps
- The dashboard imports Google Trends CSV data into Pandas DataFrames for analysis. It utilizes Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and other libraries for visualization and modeling.

Some key analysis includes:

- Yearly and category-wise search volume trends
- Time series decomposition to identify components
- Exponential Smoothing for forecasting
- Query frequency analysis with wordclouds
- Interactive line charts and heatmaps
